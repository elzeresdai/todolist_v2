## About API

<h5>Created API covers almost all requirements expect Frontednd part. 
I used Repository pattern that's mean that fronted part would be easy to implement without changing code in existed controller.
For such small application usually it's not needed, but I like well-structured code and Service Repository pattern is perfect from my perspective.
Also, I customized errors for TodoListController in big projects it makes developer life easier.
Also, added tests for TodoListController and TodoListService</h5>
